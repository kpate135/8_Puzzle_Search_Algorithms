Welcome to the CS170 - AI Project 1. This project is attempting to solve several puzzles using different algorithm types. Please wait as we list out the possible options to choose:
First please choose from the following:
        0 - Use Default Puzzle
        1 - Enter Your Own Puzzle
Choice: 1
Enter your own puzzle:
Enter first row
1 0 3
Enter second row
4 2 6
Enter third row

Thank you for Creating Your Own Puzzle
Now choose the algorithm:
        0 - Uniform Cost Search
        1 - A* with the Misplaced Tile Heuristic
        2 - A* with the Euclidean Distance Heuristic
Choice: 2
Thank you for choosing: A* with the Euclidean Distance Heuristic

Goal!!!

To solve this problem the search algorithm expanded a total of 3 nodes.
The maximum number of nodes in the queue at any one time: 9
The depth of the goal node was 3
The Solution Is:
MOVE_DOWN  MOVE_DOWN  MOVE_RIGHT  Took 16 ms
